			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>Parents across Georgia Tech rely on childcare facilities so they can work and provide for their family. The pandemic has, however, intensified issues within the childcare sector, making it difficult to find childcare. Facilities have been closed and reduced in size during the pandemic, exacerbating already long waitlists for childcare facilities.</p>
